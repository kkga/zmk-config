Keymap for 34 keys. Mostly based on
[Seniply](https://stevep99.github.io/seniply/).

### Changes from Seniply

- Shift is on the right thumb, Space is on the left thumb. I need Space when
  using a mouse with my right hand;
- Sticky mods on the Extend layer are rearranged (starting from outer column):
  `Gui` | `Alt` | `Ctrl` | `Shift`;
- Navigation cluster on the Extend uses Vim-style layout;
- Several keys and shortcuts on the Extend layer are changed;
- There is no additional Symbols layer: I have an extra `Shift` on the left
  thumb in the Number layer which is used to get remaining symbols;
- The Function layer is accessed from the Extend layer by holding the homing
  thumb key (press Ext with your index finger and then Fun with your thumb --
  not ideal, but I rarely access it). Seniply uses both thumbs for activating
  Function, but I like switching between Number and Extend quickly without
  accidentally activating the Function layer.
